# PythiaPlotter

## > WHAT IS IT
This is a little script that plots diagrams of particle interactions in MC events using GraphViz (& optionally Latex). Very handy to figure out what is actually going on in your MC!

See example in `example` folder.

## > WHAT DO I NEED:

- Your favourite MC generator

**Optional:**


## > HOW DO I GET IT:

- Clone this repo:
	```
	git clone https://github.com/raggleton/PythiaPlotter.git # https
	# or
	git clone git@github.com:raggleton/PythiaPlotter.git # ssh

	```

## > HOW DO I USE IT:


## > WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW:

- Please run with `python PythiaPlotter.py` not `./PythiaPlotter.py`. For some reason, some things don't work properly using the latter **TO BE CONFIRMED**

- There's a not totally dissimilar program, HepMC Visual, that does something similar but requires ROOT, and you have to write your own script. So YMMV.
